## Micro-Scholarships for <u>Rad</u> <u>Web</u> <u>Shit</u>.

After building side projects on the web for a decade, I still loop back to one thought:

    "How rad would it be if this could earn me some beer money?"

The internet is infinitely more cool when folks build rad shit, and those devs 100% deserve some money for caffeine, snacks, or whatever.

That's where I come in.

Every month I'll pick a new theme. If you've built something rad that fits the theme (like at ALL), feel free to submit it! I'll select three projects that stand out, write an article to showcase them, and throw each of the developers $25!

Listen, if you're reading this, you've probably built something cool. Let me give you a coffee for making the internet a more interesting place.

Time for the tech bits. HenryGives.Coffee is built on top of a GatsbyJS hello-world template (with some stuff obviously wrenched on).

Please feel free to use anything here for motivation or help when building your own site!

All I ask is that you credit me somewhere - even if it's in the source!

Clone this repo, navigate into your it's directory, and start it up.

  ```shell
  $ cd HenryGivesCoffee/
  $ gatsby develop
  ```

The site should be running at`http://localhost:8000`!

_Note: There's also a second link: http://localhost:8000/\_\_\_graphql`. (Three Underscores)_

> This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying data (here, provided mainly by `./src/resume/resume.yaml`). Learn more about using this tool in [this Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).

Open the `HenryGivesCoffee` directory in your code editor of choice and explore the code! Make some edits to `.js` files. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

Just be sure to rename the dir to whatever you want to call your project and update the upstream information so your Git client knows to communicate with a repo you own.
