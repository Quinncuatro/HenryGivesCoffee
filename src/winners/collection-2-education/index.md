## The first Henry Gives Coffee post ended with: "Hopefully, it's a wild ride."

This project continues to amaze. I thought it would just be a fun little thing I ran for a couple of months to see how it went but the submissions kept rolling on in. A little less than last month (without all the viral Reddit hype) but I'm so glad that the idea of rad web shit is resonating with so many folks.

It was so much fun looking through all the new projects. It still blows me away how people, when given access to some web tools, have a tendency to build things that can benefit others. This month of "Education" project didn't disappoint in that regard.

I whittled the list of projects down to eight in the [showcase](../../showcase) and the following six winners. Some submissions didn't match the theme and others didn't have their projects live on the web somewhere. While I loved everything y'all had to share with me, the line had to be drawn somewhere.

Please, though, read on to see why these six projects struck me as substantial contributions to the web and perfectly embody the thesis of "rad web shit for education".

## May's Most Rad ($25 each)

Every month I pick three winners out of the submissions that meet all the criteria on the [rubric](../../rubric).

They'll be projects that really embody the theme of the month, open-source their code to help others build rad things, and just generally make the web a more interesting place. And for all that, they definitely deserve some coffee!

### [The Hyberobjects Gallery for Generative Art](https://hyperobjects.design/gallery) by [Erwin](https://twitter.com/hoogerwoord)

> Erwin built a gallery for generative artworks that shows the finished work and shares the source code to help other artists learn how to create their own pieces. With the built-in workbench, the code can run live in the browser to help you learn quickly.

### [Lingraphic](https://lingraphic.app/) by [Will Fry](https://willfry.co.uk/)

> Will built Lingraphic on top of their own linguistics parser to help people learn etymology through graphic visualizations and easy to understand network graphs. This is a goldmine for anyone interested in learning about the evolution of human language.

## May's Honorable Mentions ($18 each)

Every month I pick two winners out of the submissions that _don't quite_ meet all the criteria on the [rubric](../../rubric).

They'll often be projects that are just as rad as the winners but maybe don't open source their code. They still make the web more interesting and totally deserve some coffee for their efforts!

### [Flash Math Cards](https://flashmath.cards/) by [Kyle Simpson](mailto:getify@gmail.com)

> Kyle built this website to help kids practice their math skills with interactive flash cards. With options for different kinds of problems and three difficulties, this can also be installed as a progressive web app on a smartphone for flash cards on the go.

### [Space Interns](https://spaceinterns.org/) by [Christopher Fu](https://twitter.com/cfu288)

> Chris (and their friend Caroline) built the only dedicated platform for recurring space internship and fellowship programs, scholarships, and grants. They hope Space Interns increases the diversity of the future space workforce and I hope they're right. Space exploration is near and dear to me, and this project is incredible.

## May's Community Favorite ($15 each)

Every month, a group of [my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/henrygivescoffee) patrons selects their favorite project (that aren't already winners or honorable mentions) to get half of their total donations.

I present them with a list of the other awesome projects and they vote on who receives this award. My patrons have spoken and decided that this developer DEFINITELY deserves some coffee.

### [Science By Solar](https://sciencebysolar.me/) by Jamie

> Jamie built a solar powered computer that performs medical and physics based calculation for IBM's World Community Grid Project. It makes meaningful contributions to science without taking anything in exchange. This website even gives some information on how to build a solar powered computer of your own!

Again, it was an absolute joy to check out all of the incredible things y'all built and submitted. It's always really fun to see what's going on in the non-corporatey parts of the web.

First thing tomorrow morning I'm sending out digital payments to the winners who provided a payment link and forwarding the awards for those who didn't to the folks over at [Code.org](https://code.org). If you're one of those developers and don't receive a payment by the end of the day (June 03, 2021), please reach out and I'll get you sorted.

Thank you all for building rad shit for the web. The world needs it and plenty of folks are benefitting from the projects you're maintaining.

Next month's theme is "Sharing a Hobby". If anyone reading this (or anyone you know) is working on a project that shares information about something you're passionate about, please head over to the [Submit a Project](../../submit) page and let me know about it!

It might just be you I'm giving coffee to next month.

Until then, stay frosty.
