## The web is more interesting when people are building rad shit.

So in addition to my personal space on the web over at [HenryNeeds.Coffee](https://henryneeds.coffee) I figured it was prudent to make an equal and opposite HenryGives.Coffee.

It took me a couple of days' worth of free cycles to figure this all out and get it working the way I like it, but the current version works great!

So far I've had two folks submit PR's and it went off without a hitch. They submitted their PR, I hit the "Merge" button, and the builds kicked off all on their own.

Building the feature was pretty painless given that I already had my site built on Gatsby's engine. However, adding something like this to a different static site generator or build process should be fairly easy once you understand the data flow.

Lots of folks lost their jobs over the past year, and really what's the point of having a voice, site, blog, or whatever if we don't help others climb up behind us on the same ladders?

Just something to chew on.

Stay frosty.
