Photos, videos, and bootleg(?) audio of ~250 shows in Dunedin, New Zealand. Rad as hell, dude. Having grown up with the music kids and gone to more shows than I can keep track of, this is a fantastic time capsule any scene would be lucky to have. And you can tell it's made with love. Speaking of music and GatsbyJS, I have a different side project I'll be reaching out about. ;)"
