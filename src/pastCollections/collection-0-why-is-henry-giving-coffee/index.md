## The web is astoundingly more interesting when people are building rad shit.

the internet has mostly become a collection of the same eight websites (google, yahoo, facebook, yahoo, wikipedia, reddit, netflix, instagram)

There's not the fun internet we used to have and we should really get back to that

So in addition to my personal space on the web over at [HenryNeeds.Coffee](https://henryneeds.coffee) I figured it was prudent to make an equal and opposite HenryGives.Coffee.

Just something to chew on.

Stay frosty.
